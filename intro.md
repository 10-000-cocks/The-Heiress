### III. Relation of play/play elements to heritage
- We look at what we will do and work with as building blocks, i.e.:

  - ie.: no need to *justify* against present ideas about heritage
  - but: need to *project*

- The Metallic Plate `our present idea(s) about heritage as a static offset from which to start into the Play`
  - future colonising

    - obligation
    - owing
    - lock-in ("the temporal commitment to infrastructures")
    - ...
