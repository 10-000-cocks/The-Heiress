### Play

The Play is what happens between the beginning and the end of the Play. It consists in the construction of Societies that emerge, change and develop through the interaction of Characters as embodied by Players. The Play is structured in 3 Phases.





### Societies

Societies are the changing socialities that emerge, change and develop during the Play through the interaction of Characters as embodied by Players.

### Character

Characters represent types, ideas, perspectives, motives or ideologies that Players can embody. Initially, Characters exist in the form of Character Cards (CCs). Characters become part of Society when a Player accept the prompt to embody them.

### Players

Except for the Game Master, everyone attending the Play is a Player. Depending on whether or not a Player has accepted a prompt to embody a Character, they are Non-Character Players (NCPs) or Character Players (CPs). All Players start out as NCPs. When NCPs accept a Character prompts, they turn into a CP. (Players are at liberty to reject Character prompts.)

### NCP (non-character player)

A Player that has not yet accepted a Character prompt.

### CP (character player)

A Player that has accepted a Character prompt and thus is part of the Society by embodying it.

### Game Master

The Game Master ... Both the Game Master and the Non-Character Players have the right to make Characters part of the Society by (re)programming Players using the Character Card and requesting them to embody the Character. (NCPs are programmed, CPs - because they already embody a Character - are re-programmed.)
