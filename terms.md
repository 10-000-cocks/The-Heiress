### Play

The Play is what happens between the beginning and the end of the Play. It consists in the construction of Societies that variantly emerge through the interaction of Characters as embodied by Players.

### Societies

Societies are the changing socialities that emerge during the Play through the interaction of Characters as embodied by Players.

### Players

Except for the Game Master, everyone attending the Play is a Player. Depending on whether or not a Player has accepcted a prompt to embody a Character, they are a Non-Character Players (NCPs) or a Character Players (CPs). At the beginning of the Play, all Players are NCPs. When an NCP accepts a Character prompt, they turn into a CP.

### Character

Characters are heritage motives, souls or ideologies that Players can embody. Initially, Characters exist in the form of Character Cards (CCs). Both the Game Master and the Non-Character Players have the right to inject Characters into the present Society through (re)programming Players by using the Character Card and requesting them to embody the Character. (We say NCPs are programmed, CPs are re-programmed.) Players are at liberty to reject any Character prompt.

### NCP (non-character player)

A Player that has not yet accepted a Character prompt.

### CP (character player)

A Player that has accepted a Character prompt and thus is part of the Society by embodying it.

### Game Master
