# Mechanics

## Gameplay

1. Actors stand mixed in with the Audience --> all are NCPs
2. GM begins programming NCPs --> programmed NCPs turn into CPs
3. Moves are made
	- CPs start embodying their Characters
	- Spells are cast
	- Super popwers are invoked
	- (further N)CPs are (re)programmed (by GM or remaining NCPs)
4. Phases change
5. Play ends
